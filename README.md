# Foreign-Exchange-Value-Prediction
The following project demonstrates EUR/USD exchange value prediction over a wide time frame.
Different time series techniques like Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test for stationary test, differencing method for making the data stationary and smoothing technqiues like moving average are performed for the preprocessing of the data.
Moreover, the project showcases different models and metric scores of different time series models like AutoRegressive model, moving average, ARIMA, SARIMAX, ETS models are used. On top of that, the study also compares their results with results from neural networks techniques like LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU etc.
